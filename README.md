# SkillX-De-centralized-skill-verification-system
This repository includes the framework of a De-centralized skill veriification system which uses Solidity as its prior language to launch the smart contracts.
tech-stack included:


1).Node and npm

2).Ganache

3).Truffle

4).Metamask


We are using React.js and Web3.js for the frontend of the web app and Solidity to create Ethereum compatible smart contracts, to be deployed on the Polygon network. 
By using the Polygon network, we are relying on the security of the Ethereum network while benefitting from low gas fees and high throughput of Polygon's layer 2 scaling at the same time. 
This will allow for a much more robust solution by increasing the number of peak allowable simultaneous users while maintaining a viable response time.
